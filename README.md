# EDR Home Lab: Attack and Defense
## Introduction
In this home lab, based on Eric Capuano's blog post [*So You Want To be a Soc Analyst?*](https://blog.ecapuano.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-a-soc-analyst-intro?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), we'll be setting up a realistic cybersecurity scenario. 

The lab will involve creating two virtual machines: one running Linux Ubuntu (acting as the attacker) and the other running Windows (serving as the victim). The Linux machine will use [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki), a Command & Control (C2) framework, to simulate a cyber attack, while the Windows machine will employ [LimaCharlie](https://limacharlie.io/) SIEM as an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution to detect and respond to the attack.

**Key Skills**: 
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) (LimaCharlie - Threat Hunting, Rule Creation, Log Analysis)
- Threat Detection & Incident Response (Sysmon - Event Logging & Analysis, Windows Security Event Monitoring)
- Adversary Simulation & Red Teaming (Sliver C2 - Command & Control, Payload Deployment, Evasion Techniques)
- Log Analysis & SIEM (Windows Event Viewer, LimaCharlie - Log Forwarding & Correlation)
- Windows Security & Hardening (Defensive Monitoring, Attack Investigation, Policy Implementation)

#

## Setup
To start the lab, we'll set up both the Ubuntu (Linux) and Windows machines. A key step is disabling Microsoft Defender on the Windows 11 machine. On the Ubuntu machine, we'll install Sliver to use as the attacking tool. Meanwhile, LimaCharlie will be configured as a sensor and EDR solution on the Windows machine, with Sysmon logs being imported for monitoring.

## Attack & Defense Machine
On the Ubuntu machine, we generate a malware payload named 'CONTENT_CABIN' using Sliver. This payload is then staged on the Windows machine, preparing it for use. To safeguard the lab, we create a snapshot of the Windows machine, allowing us to easily revert any mistakes that might compromise the environment.

#

We can examine our privileges and other details provided by the payload via SSH on the Linux machine. In the LimaCharlie SIEM, we can observe the telemetry data and detect the malware activity from the attacker.

#

We also utilize LimaCharlie to scan the hash of the generated payload, but it remains undetected due to its custom creation. This underscores the importance of not blindly trusting an object simply because it appears secure.

#

We can now examine how 'CONTENT_CABIN' is being utilized and gather additional details by using multiple methods to review our timeline.

We will now implement detection and response mechanisms for such events and conduct tests to ensure their effectiveness.

#

Instead of focusing solely on detecting threats, we can now practice using LimaCharlie to create a rule that detects and blocks attacks originating from the Sliver server. On the Ubuntu machine, we will simulate aspects of a ransomware attack by attempting to delete volume shadow copies. In LimaCharlie, we can monitor the telemetry and then develop a rule to fully block the attack. Once the rule is implemented in our SIEM, the Ubuntu machine will be unable to execute the same attack again.

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Difficulty establishing a connection between the Sliver C2 server on the Ubuntu Linux machine and the Windows 11 machine using Port 80 (HTTP).

**Solution**: After researching and troubleshooting, I realized the issue was due to not having the necessary administrative privileges. By using the `sudo su` command to elevate my permissions on the Ubuntu machine, I was able to successfully establish the connection between the Sliver C2 server and the Windows 11 machine.
